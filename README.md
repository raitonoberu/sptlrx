</details>

### Spotify

```yaml
# config.yaml
cookie: <your cookie>
player: spotify
```

If you want to use Spotify as your player or lyrics source, you need to specify your cookie.

1. Open your browser.
2. Press F12, open the `Network` tab and go to [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com/).
3. Click on the first request to `open.spotify.com`.
4. Scroll down to the `Request Headers`, right click the `cookie` field and select `Copy value`.
5. Paste it to your config.

You can also set the `SPOTIFY_COOKIE` environment variable or pass the `--cookie` flag.

**TREAT YOUR COOKIE LIKE A PASSWORD AND NEVER SHARE IT**

### MPD

```yaml
# config.yaml
player: mpd
mpd:
  address: 127.0.0.1:6600
  password: ""
```

MPD server will be used as a player.

### Mopidy

```yaml
# config.yaml
player: mopidy
mopidy:
  address: 127.0.0.1:6680
```

Mopidy server will be used as a player.

### MPRIS

```yaml
# config.yaml
player: mpris
mpris:
  players: []
```

Linux only. System player that supports MPRIS protocol will be used. You can also specify a whitelist of players to use, example: `players: [rhythmbox, spotifyd, ncspot]`. Run `playerctl -l` to get the names.

### Browser

```yaml
# config.yaml
player: browser
browser:
  port: 8974
```

You need to install a [browser extension](https://wnp.keifufu.dev/extension/getting-started). If you don't change the default port, no further configuration is required. Otherwise, create a custom adapter in the extension settings. **You can only run one instance on one port.**

### Local

```yaml
# config.yaml
local:
  enabled: true
  folder: ""
```

Display lyrics from local `.lrc` files.

By default, the application will look for a file that is a sibling of a local music file (e.g. local player via mpris), i.e. with the same path, with the extension replaced by `.lrc`.

If the `folder` config option is set, it will additionally search for files within that folder. If the player provides a relative path to the music file (e.g. mpd), an exact match is attempted first as described above. If that fails, a best-effort search will be performed, returning a `.lrc` file in the folder (can be nested) with the most similar name.

All other lyrics sources will be disabled.

## Information

### Source

If you specify your Spotify cookie, the lyrics will be fetched using your account. Otherwise, the API [hosted by me](https://github.com/raitonoberu/lyricsapi) will be used. It is also possible to host your own API or use local `.lrc` files.

### Piping

Run `sptlrx pipe` to start printing the current lines to stdout. This can be used in various status bars and other applications.

### Flags

You can pass flags to override the style parameters defined in the config. Example:

```sh
sptlrx --current "bold,#FFDFD3,#957DAD" --before "104,faint,italic" --after "104,faint"
```

List of allowed styles: `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `strikethrough`, `blink`, `faint`. The colors can be either in HEX format, or ANSI 0-255. The first color represents the foreground, the second represents the background.

Run `sptlrx --help` to see all the flags.
